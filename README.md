# Credit-Card-Financial-Dashboard-Project

**Power BI**: Develop an interactive dashboard to visualize key credit card metrics such as outstanding balances, transaction volumes, customer segmentation, and payment trends. The dashboard will provide real-time insights to help financial analysts make informed decisions.
  
**SQL**: Use SQL to extract, transform, and load (ETL) credit card transaction data from multiple sources into a structured database. This data will serve as the backbone for Power BI visualizations, ensuring accuracy and up-to-date reporting.
